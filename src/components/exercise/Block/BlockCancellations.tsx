      <h2>Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> After a stuttering moment, the speaker often feels frustrated or embarrassed. Cancellations help by stopping after a stutter, reflecting, and trying again with more control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> After a block, pause briefly, mentally review the stutter, and then repeat the word more smoothly. This builds confidence and helps prevent habitual stuttering.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Say a sentence. If a block occurs, stop immediately after the stuttered word.</li>
          <li>Pause for 2-3 seconds, think about what happened, and remind yourself to speak slowly and gently.</li>
          <li>Repeat the word in a relaxed manner (e.g., "ba... ball").</li>
          <li>Gradually increase sentence complexity during practice.</li>
        </ol>
