      <h2>Pull-Out Technique</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Blocks occur when there is a sudden interruption in airflow or voice, often due to excessive tension in the articulators or vocal cords. The speaker feels "stuck" on a sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> The Pull-Out Technique teaches the speaker to pause in the middle of a block, reduce tension, and gently ease out of the word instead of forcing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>When you sense a block, stop and take a deep breath.</li>
          <li>Focus on relaxing your mouth, tongue, and throat.</li>
          <li>Gently continue the word from the blocked sound (e.g., "s...smooth").</li>
          <li>Practice this with different words and sentences until it feels natural.</li>
        </ol>
