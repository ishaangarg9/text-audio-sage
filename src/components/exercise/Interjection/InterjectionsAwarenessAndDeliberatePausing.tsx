      <h2>Awareness and Deliberate Pausing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Interjections (e.g., "um", "uh") are often used as a filler when a speaker feels pressure to respond quickly or is unsure of what to say. They can disrupt fluency and lead to stuttering.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Build awareness of when and why you use interjections, and replace them with intentional pauses to give your brain time to organize thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Record a conversation and identify interjections like "um", "uh".</li>
          <li>Practice speaking sentences with intentional pauses instead of fillers.</li>
          <li>For example, "I went to the... (pause)... store yesterday."</li>
          <li>Gradually reduce reliance on fillers by training in different scenarios.</li>
        </ol>
