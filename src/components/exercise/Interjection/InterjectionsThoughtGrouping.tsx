      <h2>Thought Grouping</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Speaking in long, unstructured sentences increases cognitive load, making stuttering more likely. Thought grouping helps manage this by organizing speech into smaller, meaningful chunks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Break sentences into logical phrases, inserting slight pauses at natural breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Write sentences and mark natural pauses (e.g., "Yesterday, I went to the store / and I bought some apples.").</li>
          <li>Speak slowly, pausing at the marks while maintaining a steady pace.</li>
          <li>Combine thought groups naturally without sounding robotic.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
