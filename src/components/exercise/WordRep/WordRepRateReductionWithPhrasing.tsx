      <h2>Rate Reduction with Phrasing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Speaking too quickly increases the chance of stuttering. The brain and articulators canâ€™t keep up with the pace, leading to breakdowns in fluency like repetitions or blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Break speech into small, natural groups of words (thought groups). Pause briefly between groups to slow down and maintain control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Write a sentence (e.g., "I went to the market to buy some fruits").</li>
          <li>Insert natural pauses after 3-4 words ("I went to the market / to buy some fruits").</li>
          <li>Say the sentence aloud, emphasizing the pauses and keeping a calm pace.</li>
          <li>Use your finger or a hand gesture to mark the pauses visually if helpful.</li>
        </ol>
