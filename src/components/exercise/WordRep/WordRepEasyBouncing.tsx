      <h2>Easy Bouncing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Word repetitions occur when a speaker involuntarily repeats sounds or syllables, often due to difficulty in transitioning smoothly into words. This may stem from tension, anticipation of stuttering, or a learned habit of speaking under stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Easy Bouncing helps reduce tension by repeating the initial consonant sound lightly before moving into the rest of the word. For example, "b-b-b-ball" with a gentle and relaxed repetition, not forceful or tense. The goal is to ease into the word rather than forcing it out.

        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Pick simple words (e.g., "baby", "puppy", "daddy").</li>
          <li>Say the initial sound 2-3 times gently, maintaining a soft tone (e.g., "b-b-b-baby").</li>
          <li>Keep your voice and articulators relaxed, avoiding tight lips or jaw clenching.</li>
          <li>Progress to sentences once comfortable.</li>
        </ol>
