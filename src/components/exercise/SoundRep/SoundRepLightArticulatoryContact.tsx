      <h2>Light Articulatory Contact</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Tense and forceful articulation can lead to stuttering because the muscles involved in speech become rigid, making smooth airflow and sound production difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Focus on making sounds with a gentle touch of the speech organs (lips, tongue, etc.). This promotes smoother airflow and reduces pressure that can trigger repetitions or blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Practice saying soft consonants like /p/, /t/, /k/ by touching lips or tongue gently.</li>
          <li>For example, say "puppy" by letting the lips touch lightly without pressing hard.</li>
          <li>Repeat with other words and phrases, keeping articulation light and relaxed.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
