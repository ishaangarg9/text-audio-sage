      <h2>Stretch and Slide</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Abrupt, choppy transitions between sounds create a stuttering pattern. Stretching initial sounds helps bridge the gap between sounds and promotes fluency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Elongate the first sound of a word and glide smoothly into the rest of the word. This reduces tension and improves control.

      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose a word like "sun" and stretch the first sound ("sssssun").</li>
          <li>Keep the sound continuous and gentleâ€”no breaks or sudden stops.</li>
          <li>Try this with different words and then in sentences, always focusing on smoothness.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
