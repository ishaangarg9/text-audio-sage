      <h2>Contrast Practice</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Tension often builds up unconsciously during speech. Contrast practice helps the speaker become aware of this tension by deliberately contrasting tense speech with relaxed, smooth speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Alternate between "tight" speech (deliberately tense) and "relaxed" speech to develop self-awareness and control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Say a word with tight, choppy articulation (e.g., "ba...ba...ba...ball").</li>
          <li>Then repeat the word with relaxed, flowing speech (e.g., "b-b-b-ball").</li>
          <li>Feel the difference and practice transitioning smoothly.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </div>
