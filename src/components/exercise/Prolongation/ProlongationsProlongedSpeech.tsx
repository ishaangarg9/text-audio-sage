      <h2>Prolonged Speech</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Happens:</strong> Stuttering often arises from abrupt transitions between sounds. Prolonging speech allows the speaker to reduce tension and maintain control over airflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Practice:</strong> Stretch out each sound or syllable, focusing on smooth and continuous speech without rushing.

        <strong>Detailed Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with a word like "my", saying "mmmmmy" slowly and smoothly.</li>
          <li>Apply this technique to short phrases, e.g., "My name is..." - "Mmmmmy naaame iiiis...".</li>
          <li>Practice daily with new sentences.</li>
